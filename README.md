## Goal of this Capstone

As a job-seeker, salary negotiation is one of the most difficult parts of an interview process. As an employer, being sure that you are not undervaluing (or overvaluing) an employee is important for long-term business prospects. Therefore, this capstone tackles how to evaluate the salary of a Data Scientist. This capstone uses experience, age, gender, education, major, and industry to build a supervised machine learning model to predict whether or not an individual will earn more than the median salary of a Data Scientist.
